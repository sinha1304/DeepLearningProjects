# DeepLearningProjects
Projects related to deep learning concepts such as CNN, RNN, etc

These projects were done as part of deeplearning.ai course by Andrew Ng on coursera.


## Art_Generation
Train a CNN model that creates art with style similar to a certain style.

## TriggerWordDetection:
Design a sequence model that detects trigger words among any word input.

## Jazz_Improvization
Train a model that outputs jazz music.

## ImageSegmentation:
A type of Unet model trained to detect different types of objects in a picture.
